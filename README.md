# SportHeroes


## Inspiration
All the Sports stars over the world who have bought fame to our countries.

## What it does
SportsHeroes is a web portal that serves its users the best sports products all over the world. It comprises of the worldâ€™s best sports star's profiles along with the sports they had brought fame to their countries. There is a cart in the top right corner which collects and bills up the total amount of the products the user purchases. This is a static website just to have a glimpse of how will it be taken forward and further technologies will be implemented on it. There are different web pages like Home, About Us, All Products listed on the website as well as a Contact Us page. To have a segregated choice of products, we have different sports listed at the bottom of the website wherein on clicking the particular sport, the user will be headed to a new webpage with a collection of products of that sport.

## How we built it
I have built it using HTML and CSS. It is a beginner-friendly website and requires more tech stacks to be worked on.

##Technical Description
HTML is used to structure the webpage wheresas CSS is used to increase the UI as well as improve the styling and colors in th page.
